        I possess extensive experience in developing web and mobile applications
        that deliver tangible value. During my internship at Full Scale, I also
        created personal projects to further hone my skills. My areas of
        expertise include JavaScript, React JS, and C#.Net, and I have a solid
        understanding of the SCRUM framework for developing software products. I
        also have experience in Java and React Native. Additionally, I hold a
        PhilNits IP Passport certificate, which validates my strong foundation
        in general knowledge within the IT industry. With my skills and
        experience, I can assist the development team in creating software
        products that meet the clients&#39; requirements.
